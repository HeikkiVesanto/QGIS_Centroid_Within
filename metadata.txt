name=Select Within
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Centroid within, point of surface within, pole of inaccessibility within, percentage within, and mostly within selection. Works best with lines and polygons, but should work with other geometries as well.

about=Centroid within point of surface within, pole of inaccessibility within, and mostly within selection. Centroid not guaranteed to be within the original geometry, while the other two centroid selection types are. Pole of inaccessibility is done using the polylabel algorithm: https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel as implemented in the QGIS core code. Works best with lines and polygons, but should work with other geometries as well.
